# CSE341 Project - User and Product API

This project is part of the **CSE341** class at Brigham Young University - Idaho. It is an API for managing **User** and **Product** data with full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality. The project utilizes **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose** to create a dynamic backend and follows RESTful API principles.

## Project Overview

This API was developed with a focus on data management and authentication. It incorporates:
- **CRUD operations** for managing users and products in a MongoDB database.
- **Swagger documentation** for clear API endpoint descriptions and easy testing.
- **GitHub OAuth** for secure user login and logout capabilities.

### Key Features

- **User Management**: Create, view, update, and delete user data securely.
- **Product Management**: Manage products with CRUD operations, enabling product creation, viewing, updating, and deletion.
- **Secure Authentication**: GitHub OAuth provides login and logout functionality for authorized access.
- **Swagger API Documentation**: Accessible documentation for testing and exploring API routes.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
- **Express** - Web framework to manage API routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB** - Database for storing user and product data.
- **Mongoose** - Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- **Swagger** - API documentation tool for easy testing and exploration.
- **GitHub OAuth** - Authentication service for user login and logout.
